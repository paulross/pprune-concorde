  This is off-topic, so I ain't going to bang on this subject after this post, but I wouldn't be so quick to denigrate former Soviet technology in all cases. Those "agricultural" fighters can mix it up with the best the west has to offer (until - or if - the F22 comes online) in terms of manoeuvering ability, if not in terms of weapons. Elements of their rocket technology were in advance of what we had at the time, and the solutions they came up with to put the Tu-144 in the air may have been crude, but they were to some degree effective, which can denote an elegant solution in itself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, this thread is about an aircraft which was the result of - unarguably - some of the best engineering in aviation history, and I'd much rather talk about that!

  To conclude this slightly o/t story :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tu144D was the last production model of the Tu144.
  <br/>
  With improved engines and other refinements, it was capable of supercruise (Mach 2 without afterburners). Only five were built, and they came too late ; the aircraft went out of service, and were put into storage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tu-144D s/n 77114 was brought out of mothballs (with less than 83 hours "on the clock") for the joint NASA/Russian program in the '90s and modified, with completely new more powerful engines (same as those of the 'Blackjack' Tu-160 bomber) and a fit of sensors and test equipment, to become the Tu-144LL (flying laboratory). A total of 27 flights were made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The entire "High Speed Civil Transport" study indeed cost over $300M, but the actual work on the Tu-144LL reputedly cost less than $20M, although it's not known exactly what that bill represents.

  Yes indeed.
  <br/>
  That sort of discussion belongs in the Military Aircrew forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One could say that the Tu-144, and also the Boeing 2707 and Lockheed L2000 were part of the background against which Concorde was born.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But "F-4 v a Mig 19/21" is not really part of that context...... so please?

  LOL !

  True though... they're little more than two small flat surfaces... clearly marked "
  <b>
   NO STEP
  </b>
  ", so they're not even any use for standing on to clean the windows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They look pretty insignificant, compared to the 'canards' of the Tu-144 or the big foreplanes on some other deltas, or the long forward wing extensions on aircraft like the F-16 and F-18, none of which have the same function.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And to be perfectly honest, I myself didn't know about their real function until after 2003, when I started delving into a lot of other technical aspects of 'our Lady'.

  The full list of names (up to 2002) for both BA and AF can be found in "The Concorde Story" by Chris Orlebar. For BA, a quick count shows about 170 names. That book also mentions, that the maximum number of crews qualified at any one time was 28, in 1980, and that the average was about 20 crews.

  Photos can lie.... or rather, they are rarely close-up enough to show clearly where corrosion has set in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an example, F-BVFC at Toulouse, which was the last one to remain at least taxyable, now has some patches of corrosion starting to show, when you know where to look. Not to mention the nasty smell of damp and mould in the cockpit which bodes no good for what's going on underneath the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And even F-BTSD, kept "live" to some extent at Le Bourget, leaks some hydraulic fluid (like all Concordes did on the ground), so it's easy to imagine the dried-out hydraulic and fuel seals on the other museum aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  And yes, that's kitty litter...
  <br/>
  The composite material of the floor and the hydraulic fluid don't agree too well.

  , correct me where I'm wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * Most deltas develop some vortex lift, and there were several deltas flying long before Concorde, so the phenomenon was not unknown.
  <br/>
  Shaping the wing, and in particular the leading edge, optimised the effect on Concorde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * The ogee (slender delta) wing was original proposed by NASA (possibly still NACA at the time) as best suited for a supersonic transport. The information was in the public domain by the time the "BAC223" and "Super Caravelle" were first revealed (they later "merged" into the Concorde design).
  <br/>
  The Tu-144 design used the same information, which is a major reason for its resemblance to Concorde, rather than espionage...
  <br/>
  How much the full advantages of the 'vortex lift' were understood at the time, is still an open question, IIRC.
  <br/>
  I'll have to look for the original NASA TN (Tech Note)... it may be on the web somewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * I would think the Handley Page HP115 slender-delta low-speed test aircraft must have contributed some details about vortex lift.

  Sorry, I can't find my own photos of the beast.
  <br/>
  It's now in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton (UK), together with Concorde 002 and the BAC-221.
  <br/>
  It still has the "smoke tube" on the left wing leading edge, that was used to visualise the vortex over the wing (not yet fitted when the photo above was taken).

  Quite true, and I hope I didn't give the impression that it was otherwise. On this side of the Atlantic France had the Mirage series, UK the Javelin, the two Avro aircraft and of course the FD2. However these all had relatively rounded leading edges which reduced the effect somewhat.

  I must admit that I was not aware that NACA had proposed an ogee wing for supersonic transports, although all the US SST designs featured 'double deltas' . Ken Owen's book says that US firms had been working on SST research and design studies since the late 1950s, and since the UK equivalent, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC) ran from 1956 to 1959 and definitely included sharp-edged slender wings amongst their studies, I would say UK work was at least in parallel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But to be frank, the basic idea sprang from German research done during WW2. They were well ahead in knowledge of the aerodynamics of delta wings as part of their research into aircraft suitable for the higher speeds that went with those new-fangled jet engines. Then, after the war's end, the German scientists migrated to either the UK and US (if they were lucky) or got carried off to Russia. They brought with them all the knowledge they had gained (and of course there were specific trained teams whose job it was to search the German research establishment records for any useful data. On the UK side certainly the idea of exploiting vortex lift for use on an SST was generated by German researchers working at the RAE (Kuchemann and Weber in particular). My guess (I don't know for sure) is that similar things happened in the US, although "their Germans" seemed to be more interested in rocketry.

  Not as much as you might think, because like the 221 it was too late to have much influence and it also was built to study slender delta handling, in particular a possible problem known as 'Gray's oscillations' rather than vortex lift as such.

  I hope that these pictures were of interest and can spark some further discussion in this amazing thread. If I can have the temerity to start the ball rolling with a TU-144 question, I was intrigued to notice the following tiny vane situated on the fuselage base between engines 2 and 3. Closer inspection revealed an adjacent hole, perhaps indicating pressure measurement? Anyway, ideas or proven fact welcome!

      Yes, the Tupolev canards were a novel feature, but I understand they were only necessary in the first place because of lower speed control issues as a result of more basic aerodynamics.

  Dunno about the source of your info on this but it may have got a bit garbled in the telling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a plain slender delta on the approach the trailing edge control surfaces will be slightly up and as speed is reduced this angle will increase slightly. If you want to raise the nose in the flare then even more stick back will be needed. This gives - if you like - a wing with a negative flap angle and so rather less lift needing a higher speed than you miught wish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you add some canards to give a big nose up force then to trim the aircraft the trailing edge surfaces will all be down a bit - giving a flapped delta with considerable benefit in terms of reduced approach speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tu144 with canards was able to land on the display runway at Le Bourget and take the second turn off right to the aircraft park - a quite remarkable demonstration of its modest speed on finals.

  I suspect that, given the Concorde's rather unusual fuel consumption figures, the most efficient climb profile was also the fastest one, since pretty much anything other than the M2.0 cruise-climb was fairly inefficient. From way back in the thread (
  <a href="http://www.pprune.org/tech-log/423988-concorde-question-77.html#post6904411" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  ) the minimum time to hit M1.0 was about six minutes, and M2.0 came at 9 minutes (although a few posts later someone mentions that these figures may be wrong as the fuel transfer rate wouldn't allow such a fast climb).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some questions from me, after reading through the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Someone mentioned that, as a result of Concorde's sustained supercruising across the Atlantic, the twenty-odd Concordes have more supersonic flight hours than all other aircraft combined. Does anyone know what the figures are?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - What was the minimum range for supersonic travel to be worthwhile? Obviously if you were only going a few hundred kilometres it'd make more sense to cruise at 29000ft an M0.95 rather than climbing all the way up to 40000ft+ and M2.0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - What other aircraft are/were more efficient supersonic than subsonic? The modern supercruising fighter jets (eg. the F-22) are still more efficient at subsonic speeds. The original Tu-144 would certainly have been much more efficient subsonic (since it couldn't supercruise); I'm not sure about the later models. The SR-71 was more efficient at high supersonic speeds than at low supersonic speeds, but I can't find anything about subsonic fuel consumption. And that leaves the XB-70, which is just a big unknown.

  Getting somewhat closer to the topic - does anyone know what the Tu-144 used for computing? The NASA report on the Tu-144LL says that they had a digital controls for the engines, but since those were new engines the control system was probably a good deal more modern than the original. I can't see any mention of how the intakes were controlled, or what the original engines used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And really on-topic, was there any work done towards updating this for Concorde-B? Or did they never get that far? Or was the plan to just keep using exactly the same stuff, since it was already working so well?

  Most people are familiar with the space race between the US and the Soviets, but there was a very interesting race between the US, Europe and the Soviet Union to build a supersonic passenger aircraft. Europe built the successful Concorde, the US had the unsuccessful Boeing SST, and the Soviets had the unsuccessful Tu-144.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Somewhere there is a taped phone conversation of President Kennedy raising heck with someone over the fact that the US does not have a supersonic passenger aircraft program to compete with Concorde.
