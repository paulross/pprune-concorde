  I can't be positive about the INS (inertial nav system).
  <br/>
  The prototypes used a SAGEM/Ferranti system, replaced by a Litton system on the preprods, then Delco on the production aircraft.
  <br/>
  There
  <i>
   may
  </i>
  have been magnetic core in the prototype INS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As to the AICS (air intakes) and AFCS (automatic flight control), the answer is a definite NO. The AICUs used PROMs (fuse type, not EPROM) and the AFCS was entirely analog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the systems were even more 'antique'...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ADC (air data computer) for instance was still largely electro-mechanical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And those nifty NAV and COMM frequency selectors, that always stand out on cockpit pictures... no electronics at all, just a set of wafer switches, and about thirty wires linking them to the transmitters/receivers.

  It always was a bit of a paradox; in terms of fuel price and environmental concerns, Concorde was about 5 years too late. But in ELECTRONICS terms she was 10 years too early. Bearing in mind that the first Intel 4004 was not even commercially available until 1971. When the decision was taken in late 1970 to 're-design' the analog air intake control system into a digital one, there was nothing to fall back on; a BAC custom guided missile processor (used I believe on both the Rapier and Sea Dart SAMs) had to be adapted. This processor was, as I've yawned on about before, comprised of multiple double sided PCBs completely stacked with TTL ICs. In spite of being a total antique and a dinasore (just like me
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/boohoo.gif" title="Boo Hoo"/>
  ) this thing was really cutting edge technology at the time, even using a 64 bit data word. The AICS as again I've yawned on about before, was the WORLD's first commercial airborne digital control sysstem, but the Concorde analog stuff in fact worked pretty well indeed.

  As always GF you make your point really well. As far as Concorde went, the very few American (Branniff) pilots who flew her thought she was totally amazing, and the American BA engineers at JFK and IAD absolutely adored the aeroplane.
  <br/>
  And back to your 'charriot', the C5 has been a staggeringly successful aeroplane in terms of US service. and is still thriving (big modernisation programme underway). Not bad for an aircraft that entered USAF service in 1969!!!

  Before adding my own little bit to Clive's earlier reply about the autotrim, I will try to explain, for those not fully familiar with the subtleties of automatic flight control, the difference between "closed loop" and "open loop".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Closed loop
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an example, let's look (very simplified) at how the autopilot maintains a selected altitude.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" border="0" class="post_inline_image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v324/ChristiaanJ/Closedloop.gif"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the one hand we have the
  <u>
   desired altitude
  </u>
  as selected on the autopilot controller (here 40,000 ft).
  <br/>
  On the other hand we have the
  <u>
   true altitude
  </u>
  , as measured by the altimeter (let's say 39,000 ft).
  <br/>
  We subtract the two to obtain the
  <u>
   altitude error
  </u>
  (in this case 39,000-40,000=-1,000 ft).
  <br/>
  We 'multiply' the altitude error by a factor, the
  <u>
   gain
  </u>
  (for the discussion, let's assume this gain is 1 degree elevon per 1000 ft altitude error), and send the resulting elevon position command to the elevon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, the elevon moves 1\xb0 nose-up, the aircraft starts to climb, the altitude
  <i>
   increases
  </i>
  and the altitude error
  <i>
   decreases
  </i>
  until it becomes zero, by which time the elevon position has also returned to zero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we have now is a "closed loop" : any deviation from the selected altitude results in an elevon command in the opposite direction, until the deviation is again reduced to zero.
  <br/>
  Another commonly used term is "feedback" : any error is
  <i>
   fed back
  </i>
  in the opposite sense until it's reduced to zero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The significant figure here is the 'gain'.
  <br/>
  If the gain is too small, the autopilot response to a disturbance (say turbulence) will be sluggish ; the aircraft takes too long to return to the desired altitude.
  <br/>
  If the gain is too high, a small disturbance will cause the aircraft to start climbing too rapidly, and to overshoot the desired altitude, then descend to correct the new error, etc.
  <br/>
  In other terms, the control loop is no longer stable, but starts to oscillate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both theory and practice show that the exact value of the gain is not all that critical, a few percent more or less do not markedly change the response of the loop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note: a "closed control loop" as described above can be implemented in just about any way you like.
  <br/>
  It can be done purely mechanically, with a few clever clockwork mechanisms 'computing' the altitude error and controlling the elevator pneumatically or hydraulically. It's how the earliest autopilots worked.
  <br/>
  After that came electromechanical systems, analogue computers and then digital computers... but the principle has remained unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Open loop
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As already described in earlier posts, the situation with the automatic trim is the opposite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" border="0" class="post_inline_image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v324/ChristiaanJ/Openlooptrim.gif"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We now need to compute a neutral elevon position from several data, such as Mach number or airspeed, but without any feedback as to whether our computations are correct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We're now working in "open loop".
  <br/>
  To complicate matters... that neutral elevon position is not a simple linear function of Mach and airspeed, but far more complex (see the earlier posted graphs).
  <br/>
  And because of the large response of the aircraft to small changes in trim, in particular in the transonic regions, those computations have to be far more accurate : a one degree error is simply not acceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end.....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AICS (air intake control system) also uses several "open loop" functions.
  <br/>
  The early development aircraft still had an analogue system, which proved all too soon to be inadequate, so, at a very late stage, it was replaced by a digital system (one of the rare digital systems on Concorde).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "open loop" functions of the autotrim system initially had the typical "a few" percent" accuracy of the other flight control systems, which, for the autotrim, also proved inadequate.
  <br/>
  We managed to "save the furniture" (as they say in French) by using 0.1% components in all the critical computing paths, so the autotrim computers remained analogue until the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, a slide rule is not accurate to 0.1%... So that's when I had to buy my very first pocket calculator.
  <br/>
  \xa342 at 1972 prices... just as well the firm paid.
  <br/>

      I've noticed that several postings refer to the production AICU as a 'digital' control system. Strictly speaking it wasn't; it was a hybrid digital/analogue system where the inner dynamic control loops (the closed loop part) were analogue systems operating to maintain limits defined by the digital arithmetic processors. This allowed us to have quite sophisticated control 'laws' which would have been next to impossible with a pure analogue system.

  Yes, of course (as ever
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Stick Out Tongue"/>
  ) you are correct; it was technically a hybrid system: The servo loops, in terms of ramp and spill door demand signals and resolver position feedback signals etc. DID use conventional analogue drive and servo amplifiers within the AICU, it was the massive arithmetic computation UP-STREAM of these that was digital. I always used to like to refer to the AICS as 'an analog front end with a digital brain'. But that's just me
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/eek.gif" title="EEK!"/>
  .
  <br/>
  But as you say Clive, none of the control law sophistication (including the synthesising the intake face total pressure and local Mach numbers from mainline aircraft raw air data) would have been possible using analog computation.

  Gentlemen, I think you will find that 102 did indeed have a totally 'unique' analog intake control system. Not only were the RDCUs (not AICUs in this case chaps) totally different,
  <font color="navy">
   there
  </font>
  were major architectural changes over the prototype system too. Also, although the basic intake structure was the same as 101 and all subsequent aircraft, there was still the prototype approach to local pressure sensing adapted, ie. Intake face total pressure P∞ sensed directly via the infamous 'magic holes' rather than using digitally synthesised values based on mainline aircraft manometric probe, total (pitot)pressure. As 101's intakes only went 'live' in mid-march 1973, I assumed that maybe they (AS) wanted an operative intake system from the outset on 102 when it first flew in January of that year. What puzzled me was why they went for this seemingly enhanced (and expensive) analog system on 102 and not the original system. (As 102 used a production type intake, I guess that they would have to have at least made some changes to the control system ; there was no exotic double hinged 'Dump Door', but the far simpler and elegant 'Spill Door' with integral Aux' Inlet Vane that was known and loved by us all). Rumour had it that AS still wanted to pursue the 'magic holes' solution and were dead against the decision to go digital. (This particular decision was taken in October 1970, which makes the 102 AICS route seem all the more strange).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And ChristiaanJ; what you guys achieved with the MAX CLIMB/MAX CRUISE was nothing short of remarkable. Just about the most exotic (and complex) autopilot mode that I've ever seen, that solved so MANY problems.

      It's worth bearing in mind that even those not particularly well-disposed to Airbus will grudgingly admit that the flight deck ergonomics on those types are extremely good - and a lot of the lessons learned were from cramming all that information into Concorde's limited space.

  Errrr no, I don't think so. Concorde's flight deck was done at Filton and we had no involvement in the Airbus designs in that area.

      I have to thank EXWOK for explaining the windows - but I'll add the more prosaic reason that you don't need a particularly large window to see the curvature of the Earth in all its splendour - which is for the most part all you'd be seeing during the flight!

  Exwok's remark is not quite right IIRC. Certainly the window size was dictated by pressurisation failure, but one couldn't maintain cabin pressure with two windows failed - the design case was to get to a breathable altitude before you killed too many passengers! Also, there is very little to see when you have a delta wing under you.

  Ummm - most participants reckoned that the Concorde infrastructure showed the way not to do it, and besides the early Airbuses were developed in parallel with the later stages of Concorde development. You have a point where R&amp;D is concerned though - several technologies developed for Concorde found their way onto the subsonic fleet, not the least being the probability approach to system certification.

  Hi Christian,I was a development engineer at Filton working on the AICU at first but ending up in charge of avionics test.
  <br/>
  So as far as your AICU is concerned - I have handled all the boards extensively.
  <br/>
  I first worked on the "A" model - the first manufactured box, followed by "A bar" (logically, not "A").
  <br/>
  These did not have the doghouse connector on the front, and in order to see what was going on in the program, we made a strobe unit hard wired to the digital boards, this was followed by the connector on the front and an AICU test box.
  <br/>
  When first switched on the whole unit rattled at high speed as all the relays chattered.
  <br/>
  I spent several days adding decoupling capacitors on all the boards.
  <br/>
  The birds nest chassis wiring was chosen to prevent cross- talk.
  <br/>
  This was at the start of 1972, but I can still remember a lot of it.
  <br/>
  Someone mentioned a prom change at Casablanca, I carried out a prom change there just before the C of A flight.
  <br/>
  I am a volunteer at the Bristol Aero Collection, and we have just received a drawing cupboard with the AICS drawings.
  <br/>
  We are at the moment documenting archives. One of the volunteers is Ted Talbot who I used to work with, and has been mentioned in posts.
  <br/>
  Feel free to ask questions, I may remember the answers!

  Hi Christian,
  <br/>
  We chose the components for their environmental tests, and all the AICS components were subjected to acceptance testing when received, which was a bit of a problem sometimes because the BAC goods inwards system was so slow that some of the expensive ADC/DACs that were not quite good enough were returned to Harris, but were out of warranty by the time they were returned. The embargo was not just the 5400 TTL I/Cs but all milspec. components.
  <br/>
  Its stretching my memory, but AICU1 was the ADC board, 2-5 were the processor, 6-10 were the prom boards. There was a bought in board (AICU 17 I think) that was supplied by ?????, that processed the sensor unit data.
  <br/>
  The AICS was filled with redundancy, as well as the obvious 2 AICUs per intake, and 4 sensor units, the program calculated the output data with dummy inputs - twice, and if these were correct, the proper inputs were used and the result was output to the doors. On the analogue bit there were two channels for each output and at the end one output was compared with the other and if different a fail was produced.
  <br/>
  We haven't opened the plan chests with the AICS drawings yet.
  <br/>
  As well as the 8 AICUs on G-BOAF, we have the prototype AICU that was used on the AICS systems rig.
