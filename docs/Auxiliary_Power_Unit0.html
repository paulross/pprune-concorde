  For what it's worth, I read a book years ago. "By the Rivers of Babylon" I think it was.
  <br/>
  It involved a couple of El-Al (Yes I know hard to believe) Concordes that had APUs fitted in the area normally used as the forward baggage hold. Small it would have to be to fit methinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No idea if the author had researched it or just made it up to fit the story.

  I've read "By the Rivers of Babylon" too..... and there is some fact behind the fiction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  History does not relate if and where the El Al Concordes would have had APUs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, history DOES relate, that the two Concordes ordered by Iran Air WOULD have had APUs (which would have made sense in the Middle East).
  <br/>
  Now, Iran Air was the very last company to cancel its orders, and by the time they did, Concorde 214 (now G-BOAG) and 216 (now G-BOAF) were already well underway (they ended up flying initially as white tails).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, both 214 and 216 still have the mounting holes and fittings for an APU. Don't ask me where, but experts know where to find them to this day....

  The original BOAC/BA VC10s didn't have APUs either. The ones converted to K4s for the RAF had to have them fitted.
