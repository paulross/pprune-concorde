  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Speedbird 2, cleared take-off 31L.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You call
  <i>
   3-2-1 Now
  </i>
  , start your stopwatch, pre-set to countdown from 58 seconds, and slam the throttles fully forward till they hit the stops. Four RR Olympus engines start to spool up to full power and four reheats kick in, together producing 156,000 lbs of thrust, but at a total fuel flow of 27,000 US gallons per hour. A touch of left rudder initially to keep straight, as the #4 engine limiter is limiting the engine to 88% until 60 kts when it will release it to full power. The F/O calls
  <i>
   Airspeed building, 100 kts, V
   <font size="1">
    1
   </font>
  </i>
  , and then, at 195 kts,
  <i>
   Rotate
  </i>
  . You smoothly rotate the aircraft, lift-off occurs at around 10\xb0 and 215 kts. You hear a call of
  <i>
   V
   <font size="1">
    2
   </font>
  </i>
  but you keep rotating to 13.5\xb0 and then hold that attitude, letting the aircraft accelerate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F/O calls
  <i>
   Positive Climb
  </i>
  and you call for the
  <i>
   Gear Up
  </i>
  . On passing 20 feet radio height, and having checked the aircraft attitude, airspeed and rate of climb are all satisfactory, the F/O calls
  <i>
   Turn
  </i>
  and you slowly and smoothly roll on 25\xb0 left bank to commence the turn out over Jamaica bay. Some knowledgeable passengers will have requested window seats on the left side of the aircraft at check-in, and are now being rewarded with a very close look at the waters of Jamaica Bay going by very fast! As you accelerate through 240 kts, the F/O calls
  <i>
   240
  </i>
  and you pitch up to 19\xb0 to maintain 250 kts and keep the left turn going to pass East of CRI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  54 seconds from the start of the take off roll you hear the F/O counting down
  <i>
   3-2-1 Noise
  </i>
  whereupon the F/E cancel the re-heats and simultaneously throttles back to noise abatement power, around 96% as you pitch the nose down to 12\xb0 to maintain 250 kts. It is less than a minute from start of roll and already 435 US gallons of fuel have been used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Speedbird 2, contact departure, so long.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turning through heading 235\xb0M, the F/E quickly re-applies full dry power as you pitch up to 17\xb0 to maintain 250 kts, but simultaneously reduce the left bank to 7.5\xb0, in order to increase both the radius of turn (to stay on the optimum noise abatement track) and the rate of climb (less bank, higher RoC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On climbing through 2,500 ft you increase the bank angle back to 25\xb0 left bank and as you approach the 253\xb0 radial JFK, you hear
  <i>
   3-2-1 Noise
  </i>
  from the F/O for the second time. The F/E actions the second noise-abatement power cut back, you pitch down to 12\xb0 and, if not in cloud, sneak a quick peek out of your left hand window, looking for the car park by the Marine Parkway bridge, as you would ideally like to pass right over the car park, if possible, as we tip-toe quietly across the Rockaway Beaches, in order to minimise the noise impact on the residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keep the left turn going and intercept the 176\xb0 radial outbound from CRI, and at 5 miles DME from CRI, call for the F/E to slowly re-apply full climb power as you pitch up to maintain 250 kts. We are still in US territorial airspace, below 10,000 ft, and subject to statutory speed control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Speedbird 2, present position direct to SHIPP, climb FL230, no speed control.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F/O selects direct SHIPP in the INS and tells you that she has selected that information into your Flight Director. Having checked that the gear lever is at neutral, you call for the
  <i>
   Nose Up
  </i>
  , and then the
  <i>
   Visor Up
  </i>
  . Flight deck noise levels drop dramatically as the Visor locks up. Now more than 12 miles away from the coast, we are clear of US speed control requirements so lower the attitude to 9\xb0, accelerate to V
  <font size="1">
   MO
  </font>
  , currently 400 kts, and ask for the
  <i>
   After Take Off Checks.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Speedbird 2, present position direct to LINND, climb in the block FL550-600, accelerate Mach 2.0
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Call for the
  <i>
   Climb Checklist
  </i>
  at Mach 0.7, which will trigger the F/E to start pumping fuel rearwards to move the CG aft, then when he's done that, straight into the
  <i>
   Transonic Checklist
  </i>
  . Maintain 400 kts IAS, and around 24,500 ft, at M0.93, ask for the re-heats back on, in pairs, and raise the nose by 3\xb0 to maintain 400 kts as they kick in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Precise, smooth flying is required through the high drag transonic region, as the mach meter creeps up towards Mach 1. A sudden flicker on the VSI and Altimeter confirms that the shock wave has just passed over the static ports, and the aircraft is now supersonic. A quick glance at the elapsed time indicator shows that you\x92ve been hand flying for just over 9 minutes since the start of the take off roll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fun start to a day in the office, and to think we got paid for doing it!
  <br/>

  The route from Bahrain to London was quite good to, as once the throttles were opened for Take-off they were never touched again until the decel in the north of the Adriatic. The departure went if I remember correctly like
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throttles opened for take -0ff
  <br/>
  At 500 ft switch off reheats
  <br/>
  At 1000ft select Climb Rating with the switches on the overhead panel
  <br/>
  At M0.95 select reheats in pairs
  <br/>
  At M1.7 switch off reheats
  <br/>
  At 50,000ft select Cruise Rating on the switches on the overhead panel
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sit back and have lunch before decel
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft would be heavy and the ground temps high so the climb accel would be slower than out of Cardiff,but it was still impressive.

  Why the switches for climb and cruise ratings. What was being accomplished that modulation of the throttles couldn't. Which brings the question, why switches for the reheats rather than throttle aka military style?
  <br/>

  When this thread is finished I think we should have the info necessary to retire to the back shed and knock one up. Keep it up Gents.

  Basically because we operated the Concorde at full throttle all the time except for noise abatement until decel / descent. The schedules and ratings fine tuned the full throttle performance according to a tightly tuned regeme - and reheat was selectable on switches rather than throttle lever angle because we spent most airborne time supersonic at full (dry) power without reheat. At the time that was the unique achievement of Concorde: reheat was used for a tiny proportion of the flight and so was relegated to four little switches. It wasn't even used for a go-around. Even on three. But that's another story.

          I hope this one is interesting; it's a Rolls Royce diagram illustrating what the wildly varying differences were in terms of the engine between take off and supersonic cruise. The primary nozzle can be seen at the rear of the engine, together with the reheat assembly and the secondary nozzle (reverser buckets).

     features that made the Ol 593 such a good choice. If you look closely at the TO and cruise values you will find that at TO the overall compressor pressure ratio is 13.5 the compressor exit temperature 460 degC and the turbine inlet temperaure is 1152 degC. In cruise the pressure ratio is 10.5, the compressor exit is 565 degC and the TET 1100 degC.

     Somebody, I can't find the exact post, was asking whether the elevated cruise total temperatures affected engine life, and here we see why this is so. As Christian said in another posting, when you compress air it gets hotter - from 21 degC to 460 degC at take off and from 127 degC to 565 degC in cruise. A fundamental limit on engine operation is the turbine entry temperature. Not only does it affect the maximum TO thrust you can get but also the continued exposure to cruise TETs has a very big effect on engine fatigue life, and engine manufacturers have shown extremes of ingenuity when developing new materials and ways of cooling the blades to increase allowable TET.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <font face="Calibri">
   <font face="Times New Roman">
    <font size="4">
     The problem with supersonic operations is that you start from an elevated intake delivery temperature so that when the flow exits the compressor it is already very hot 565 instead of 460 to be exact. But the maximum temperature one can stand for fatigue reasons is limited, therefore the amount of fuel you can pour in must be limited also, and the thrust you can develop per pound of airflow is roughly proportional to the fuel input/temperature rise. To get any sensible cruise thrust then one must squeeze the cruise TET as high as you dare for fatigue reasons but also you need to keep the compression ratio down so that the temperature going into the combustion chambers is as low as you can get away with. This tend to drive engines designed for extended supersonic operations to having a low pressure ratio. This is against the trend in subsonic operations where compression ratios have been steadily increasing along with bypass ratios.

  </font>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <font face="Calibri">
   <font face="Times New Roman">
    <font size="4">
     The net result then is that the engine must be designed with a low OPR and must operate with cruise TET much closer to its TO TET value than would be necessary, or indeed desirable, on a subsonic design.

     Actually, here, as on some other apparent carry-overs, one should look at the equipment supplier rather than the aircraft manufacturer to trace continuity. Here we have Messier supplying Concorde's gear and Dowty (OK they are now part of Messier) supplying the A330. And having worked on both, I seem to remember that the means of doing the shortening are quite different.

     Yes, they both came out of the Bristol drawing office. One minor anecdote: the 'ramshorn' stick was a novelty to the Concorde flight test crews but they got to like it, or at least put up with it. All went well until it came to the time when Dave Davies, the ARB Chief Test Pilot, came to put his rubber stamp on the aircraft.

     Concorde's seats, just like those on your car, could be moved back and fore to get your legs on the pedals and up and down so you could see over the bonnet (sorry, instrument panel). The control column of course stayed in one place, so the relationship of the 'horns' to ones thighs varied with ones height. Andre Turcat was about 6ft 2in, Trubbie and the others of average height. The smallest regular pilot was Jean Franchi at, I suppose, about 5ft 7 or 5ft 8. No problems. But Dave Davies was short like me and he found that he could not get full back stick and full aileron because the ramshorn fouled his thighs.

     Consternation! Completely unacceptable! I don't know what arguments they used to convince him it was all OK really, but it got through certification. I would certainly be interested to learn from the pilots in this group as to whether it was ever a problem.

     I can't resist this one!. Has anyone ever noticed/wondered about the tiny bit of the outer elevon that has been chopped off? That was my first real input into the design as a young erk looking at variability of touchdown conditions and coming to the conclusion that if the pilot got into trouble and was trying to pick up a trailing wing with too much AoA as well then he was likely to hit the ground with the downgoing elevon. I persuaded my boss that this was so and we made a small adjustment.

          One example : in theory the aircraft did weigh 1.2 % less, so the lift was 1.2 % less and the drag was 1.2 % less, so the fuel consumption was less too, so did Concorde have another 50-odd miles range thrown in 'free' by flying higher and faster than it's low-down subsonic brethren?

       I got the Haynes Manual for Christmas. On page 95 there is a diagram and photo of the centre dash panel, showing among other things the fuel consumption gauges, which, remarkably, read up to 35 tonnes per engine per hour. There appears to be two digital displays per gauge as well as an analogue display. What was the peak consumption per engine, and why two digital displays on each gauge?

  To refresh memories, here's the only, not very helpful, entry in the Flying Manual that I've found.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  My guess is that the upper digital counter indicates the proportion of the fuel flow that goes to the reheat but it's only a guess.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorry, I have no figure for the max fuel consumption.
  <br/>
  The '35 tonnes/hr' limit on the indicator is obviously beyond the upper limit, like the speedo on a car.....
  <br/>
  But yes, fuel consumption at takeoff with reheat was horrendous, and would have emptied all the tanks in an hour or less.

  Only the lower digital counter was actually a display, and was a digital repeater of the total fuel flow information being displayed by the pointer on the dial. The upper digital counter was merely a digital indication of the value to which the internal yellow triangular bug had been set by the F/E using the bug setting knob on the lower right of the gauge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Very briefly, during the pre-flight set up, the F/E would calculated the expected fuel flows for each engine, during the take-off whilst using re-heats. He would set this on the bug, and this achieved two things.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firstly, it gave him a good visual indication whether the required fuel flows were being achieved. Too low a fuel flow would indicate a re-heat problem on that engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, it programmed the expected fuel flow into the engine take-off monitor, as this was one of the parameters that had to be satisfied in order for the monitor to illuminate the Green \x93Clear-to-Go\x94 light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Green \x93Clear-to-Go\x94 light was one of three \x93Power Management\x94 lights immediately above the N2 gauge for each engine, the other two being an Amber \x93Configuration\x94 light and a Blue \x93Reverse\x94 light. Some take-offs would require all four Green lights to be on, other take-offs, depending on ambient conditions, aircraft weight and runway length, might only require three Green lights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   ...What was the peak consumption per engine, and why two digital displays on each gauge?...
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum peak consumption predicted was 21,700 kg/eng/hr, or 86,800 kg/hr total. This would have been predicted for a re-heated take-off, at +8\xb0C, at an elevation of -1,000 PA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More typically, on a standard day, at a sea level airfield, 20,700 kg/eng/hr, or 82,800 kg/hr total. You can probably see why we turned the re-heats off fairly quickly!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   ...accelerating to Mach 2.0 and immediately slowing down again....we only went to 43,000 feet so the sky did not get very dark...
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  43,000 ft is actually a bit too low for Concorde to be at M2.0, as you may see from

  Further PS ref. the fuel flow gauge - somone wondered if the target flow veeder counter was for reheat. We now know that it wasn't, but you will see a small 'Fe' annunciation in the 9 o' clock position indicating that the gauge is measuring engine flow only. When fuel is being supplied to the reheats this changed to 'Ft' with a white background to indicate that the gauge was displaying combined fuel flow. (Fe=engine, Ft=total)

  OK, here is a photo that I took at Fairford in November 1976. I'd just had my very first Concorde flight on a brand new G-BOAD, and took this flight deck photo in the hangar later that afternoon (the doors are open hence the late afternoon Cotswold sky. The point of this rather poor (sorry guys, I was young for goodness sake) photo is to look at just how subtly different the 1976 flight deck WAS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" border="0" class="post_inline_image" src="http://i1237.photobucket.com/albums/ff476/riconc11/OADNov761.jpg"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first thing I know EXWOK and BELLEROPHON will (maybe) notice is that originally OAD had a 'normal colour' electroluminescent light plate on the visor indication panel. (If I remember rightly (it was a million years ago chaps) when this one 'stopped lighting' we could not get a replacement and had to rob 202 (G-BBDG) at Filton; this one being the same black development aircraft colour that OAD has to this day.
  <br/>
  The OTHER first thing that you may notice is the Triple Temperature Indicator on the captains dash panel. (The first officer had his in in similar position). These got moved around (twice in the end) when TCAS was installed in the mid-90's. It was amazing just how much equipment got moved around over the years, in order to 'shoe-horn in' various bits of extra equimpent.
  <br/>
  The cabin altimeter here fitted just above the #1 INS CDU also got moved (to the centre consul) when the FAA 'Branniff' modifications were embodied later in the 70's. It's spot got occupied by a standy altimeter mandated by the FAA but this was removed after Branniff ceased flying Concorde; the cabin altimeter returning to it's former home. The REALLY observant will notice that there is neither an Autoland Ca3/Cat2 identifier on the AFCS panel (glued on by BA at LHR) or the famous and precision built 'Reheat Capabilty Indicator' flip down plate fitted to the centre dash panel a few years later by BA.
  <br/>
  Also not shown here, as they were buyer furnished equipment also fitted at on delivery LHR, are the two ADEUs (Automatic Data Entry Units, or INS Card readers). These were located immediatel aft of the CDU's and were used for bulk waypoint loading ('bulk' being 9, the most that the poor old Delco INU memory could handle). These were removed in the mid 90's when the Navigation Database was fitted to Concorde INUs, and bulk loading then was achieved by simply tapping in a 2 digit code. (Hardly the elegence of FMS, but still very elegent in comparison with the ADEU's, and worked superbly). A little note about these ADEU things; You inserted this rather large optically read paper data card into the thing and the motor would suck the unsuspecting card in. As often as not the ADEU would chew the card up and spit the remnants out, without reading any data, or not even bother spitting out the remnants at all. Removing these things FINALLY when the INUs were modified was absolute joy!!
  <br/>
  ps. When G-BOAG (then G-BFKW) was delivered in 1980 it had neither any of the Branniff mods or ADEUs fitted. (Also the INS was not wired for DME updating). This meant that obviously she could not fly IAD-DFW with Branniff but also she could not do LHR-BAH either, because of the lack ADEUs. (You could not manually insert waypoints quick enough over the 'Med', or so the guys told me. So for the first few years good old FKW/OAG just used to plod between LHR and JFK. And plod she did, superbly. She never did get the ADEUs (not necessary thank goodness when the INUs got modified) but we wired in DME updating and so she could navigate around with the best of them.
  <br/>
  My gosh I do prattle on, sorry guys.

  I so remember the BAe AST images from the 1980s, I always thought what a potentially nice looking aeroplane she was. I guess that vastly improving the L/D &amp; T/W ratios could go quite a long way to improving the operating economics, but the noise issue was always going to be the crippler. (I know that they were looking at a 'leaky' version of the OLY593, ie. a very low bypass ratio, but this of course would still not really cut the mustard as far as noise goes). I guess there are no current takers then

  <br/>
  Clive, you really surprise me when you say you don't think that composites would be used from a future SST, is there a material reason for this? (I'm curious because being of a simple avionic brain, I always assumed composites would be used. But if anyone knows this stuff, you certainly would Clive
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/thumbs.gif" title="Thumb"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  To answer Mike-Bracknell's original query, as far as avionics goes we can really go to town. For her age Concorde had some truly amazing aircraft systems, for instance the flying controls. To enable mechanical control (both FBW channels failed) there was a highly complex and heavy mixing unit under the rear floor. (To mix pitch and roll pilot mechanical demands into differential elevon demand inputs). This of couse would have to be done away with, as well as the relay jacks and replaced with a pair of side-sticks. (See posts on previous page). A 2 crew operation would obviously be the way to go, but neither desirable or possible in my view when Concorde was designed.
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/evil.gif" title="Evil"/>
  A triplex or quadruplex flying control system (possibly even integrating autoflight) would replace the Concorde collection of several analog boxes with a very small handful of lightweight digital units.. The powerplant control will have major weight savings, just take a look at this lot. 8 Engine Control Units, 4 Bucket Control Units, 2 Nozzle Angle Scheduling Units, 4 Reheat Amplifiers, 8 AICUs, 4 Air Intake Sensor Units and a single Air Intake Test Unit could potentially be replaced by just 4 multi-channel EEC type units. (On subsonic aircraft the EECs are mounted on the engine itself, not sure if that's a good idea for an SST, given the operating environment. Air Data and Navigation systems take a major simplification and weight saving, the 3 INUs and 2 ADCs (All of them straight from the 'rent a hernia' store as far as weight goes), could be replaced by a single ADIRU and a SAARU. The fuel indication/management side of things (2 FQI packs, 2 level switching packs and 3 CG computers) would probably be replaced by a single Fuel Processing unit. Ahhhh perchance to dream

      You call 3-2-1 Now, start your stopwatch, pre-set to countdown from 58 seconds, and slam the throttles fully forward till they hit the stops. Four RR Olympus engines start to spool up to full power and four reheats kick in, together producing 156,000 lbs of thrust, but at a total fuel flow of 27,000 US gallons per hour. A touch of left rudder initially to keep straight, as the #4 engine limiter is limiting the engine to 88% until 60 kts when it will release it to full power. The F/O calls
      <i>

      and you slowly and smoothly roll on 25\xb0 left bank to commence the turn out over Jamaica bay. Some knowledgeable passengers will have requested window seats on the left side of the aircraft at check-in, and are now being rewarded with a very close look at the waters of Jamaica Bay going by very fast! As you accelerate through 240 kts, the F/O calls
      <i>

  I remember that -- the initial rotation was pretty normal other than being a bit faster, then from there it was brought up to a very steep climb (it feels worse than it is, but I was guessing it was around 22 or so degrees -- it has to do with eyeballing the angle of the horizon to the plane's current path -- 22.5 degrees is 1/4 the way up, 30 is 1/3, 45 is 1/2, 60 is 2/3's and so forth). Clearly I'm not a human ADI

  I think you are referring to the 100kt call, when the F/E was expected to give a call as to the state of the powerplant [both engine and reheat] achieving desired power for take off. He was assisted in this decision by the illumination of 4 green lights [ one per engine] which came on if the engine power was OK. Should one green light fail then he would confirm the correct engine operation by observing that engine's N2 and Area position

  If all OK at 100kts the F/E would call ---- "Power Set"
  <br/>
  If not all Ok then he would call ----------" Engine Failure" which would
  <br/>
  result in a rejected Take off
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the early days there was no concession and every take off had to have 4 green lights illuminated so the call then was  " 4 Greens" , but when the concession came along that term would not fit so the change in call
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concession were
  <br/>
  1] one green light out [seeabove]
  <br/>
  2] and basically if weight, and airport conditions allowed it a take off could be continued even with one reheat failed at 100kts
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to 60 kts the F/E could reselectt a failed reheat so hoping it would be
  <br/>
  OK by 100kts
  <br/>
  At 100kts the conditions in the above concessions applied
  <br/>
  Above 100kts the take off would continue even if a reheat failed however
  <br/>
  if another fails when below V1 the take off would be rejected
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So finally to answer your question the correct call [well in 1998] was
  <br/>
  <br/>
  " Power Set  "

  Thanks Brit 312. "Power set" it is, then. I was aware of the '3 reheat' possibility which is decided before T/O depending on T/O parameters ('is this a 3 re-heat day or a 4 re-heat day?').
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the P1 side of the cockpit is a small hinged piece of metal which can be moved to show '3' or '4'. This is set before flight depending on whether 3 or 4 re-heats are the acceptable minimum for take off that day, so if there is a re-heat failure on T/O, a glance at that indicator will show if it's OK to continue with '3 lit' or not.

  Ahhhh... the famous Reheat Capability Indicator. (Yes that was its official title). I seem to remember that before we did the modification to fit the 'RCI' in the late 1970s, the guys used to set an INS CDU thumbwheel as a memo to whether the take-off was a 'go-er' or a 'stopper'.
  <br/>
  It seems a million years ago when we fitted this high presicion lump of alluminium.  (Hang on a minute, it WAS

  I believe that engine #4 was limited to somewhat less than max power until 60kt because of a vibration issue. Did this mean that reheat for that engine could not be selected until 60kt was achieved?

  All 4 reheats were selected 'on' before take off. They wouldn't actually light until the engine was up to a certain power, so the answer is 'no'. The power-limiting ensures no. 4's re-heat doesn't light below 60kts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watch a video of Concorde taking off which gives the view from behind. You'll notice no.4 light up marginally after the other 3 (but there's not much in it as it didn't take the aeroplane long to get to 60kts!).

  Not quite right: the reheats ignite if
  <ul>
   <li>
    throttle lever &gt;10% open; at takeoff the throttle levers have to be slammed to fully open within a second
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    selected RHT or CTY
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    N1 &gt;81%
   </li>
  </ul>
  The N1 of number 4 engine is limited to a maximum value of 88% up to 60kts, thus within the operational requirements of the reheat.
  <br/>
  (At temperatures colder than -35\xb0C the engine control schedule limits the N1 of all engines to 88% or less.)

  Thaks Quax. So all 4 reheats should light about the same time, then, regardless of power limiting on #4? It does seem that #4 lags a fraction in vids I've seen.

  I seem to recall from my two take offs in 1978 or 9 that all four reheats were selected in pairs for take off and lit while holding on the brakes, with a preamble/warning over the PA that this was what was going to occur. Is this another indication of my failing "little grey cells" or did the procedure change?
  <br/>
  Same PA announcement and lighting in pairs also occurred when going supersonic.

  For take-off reheat was selected (armed) on all 4 engines together, and certainly not in pairs. (As was stated previously, once 81% N1 was reached the reheat light-up sequence was automatically initiated). You would not wind up on the brakes either, the carbon brakes were extremely sensitive to overtorquing. For transonic acceleration however you are quite right about the 'burners in pairs' bit.
