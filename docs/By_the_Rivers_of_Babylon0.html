  For what it's worth, I read a book years ago. "By the Rivers of Babylon" I think it was.
  <br/>
  It involved a couple of El-Al (Yes I know hard to believe) Concordes that had APUs fitted in the area normally used as the forward baggage hold. Small it would have to be to fit methinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No idea if the author had researched it or just made it up to fit the story.

  Thanks very much for your comments. It's true, that while supersonic, a windmilling Olympus engine would have sufficient N2 to keep all servics on line. (The hydraulic systems on Concorde also operated at 4000 PSI). The RAT itself was 'said' to be good down to approach speeds, fortunately we never had to find out if that was true. (Although the thing was tested routinely using a hydraulic rig to drive it and check the variable pitch speed control). Thr RAT was in fact located and stowed in the fwd part of the R/H inboard elevon Powered Flying Control Unit Fairing. It was an absolute work of art by Dowty, to make the device fit into such a small space.
  <br/>
  Yep, an ash cloud would be particularly bad news, particularly at FL600

  You are most welcome, thank you for posting this topic also. These forums are a wonderful way for all of us out there in the aviation world to share and learn interesting information from each other.

  I remember reading By the Rivers of Babylon many MANY years ago. The terrorists, I seem to remember, had a bomb fitted inside Tank 11 (the rear trim tank) during construction 'before it was welded shut'. Not sure if the author had researched how aircraft were built, but still I guess it sold a copy or two. (Well at least you and I read it).

  I've read "By the Rivers of Babylon" too..... and there is some fact behind the fiction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  History does not relate if and where the El Al Concordes would have had APUs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, history DOES relate, that the two Concordes ordered by Iran Air WOULD have had APUs (which would have made sense in the Middle East).
  <br/>
  Now, Iran Air was the very last company to cancel its orders, and by the time they did, Concorde 214 (now G-BOAG) and 216 (now G-BOAF) were already well underway (they ended up flying initially as white tails).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, both 214 and 216 still have the mounting holes and fittings for an APU. Don't ask me where, but experts know where to find them to this day....

  DunePrune, the book wasn't THAT bad.
  <br/>
  And, as you may have seen earlier in this thread, the notion of a Concorde with an APU wasn't all that far-fetched, especially for an El-Al Concorde.
