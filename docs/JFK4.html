  10 minutes to Mach 1?? What rate of climb was obtained once everything was stabilised and climb speed was reached (obviously without any step restrictions)?? In my world (and everyone's now, unfortunately) a full contingent of passengers would be lifted to maybe +/- 20,000 feet in that time, not supersonic territory at that altitude without government instructions and an enemy!!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I take it Barbados was similar? 3 2 1 Now, and the next touch of the throttles was at top of descent at the other end??
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Been stated before, but John Hutchinson's interview on the OmegaTau podcast, and the video of Dave Rowland and Roger Bricknell going to JFK and back are essential for any self respecting enthusiast... I don't suppose they are the real names of some of the experts contributing to this thread are they?

  98 Pages - have read them all. Absolutely unique given the tailspin that a lot of threads (not just on this site) find themselves in - this thread is a credit to those who have made it so captivating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I lived in the UK for 10 years and was lucky enough to (well my wife did) win a return for 2 to NY on Concorde. Courtesy of the Evening Standard. This was June 1997. We sat in 3A/B and as an avid aviation follower (my dad flew in the RNZAF) spent way longer than my welcome in the cockpit when it was our turn. Purely because unlike a lot of other people who pointed and wowed - I spoke to the F/E and the skipper (Mike Bannister) about the flying aspect and marvelled at the engineering and the systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My dad broke the sound barrier in 1963 in an F-105 in Thailand somewhere whilst on manoeuvres with the USAF and as a wee chap always remember the mach meter at 1.06. So I asked Capt Bannister if he would take a picture of this for me from the same aspect - and he did. I proudly showed my dad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So on the way back from NY on boarding I asked the Chief Purser if there was any chance of sitting in the cockpit for landing - a fairly stern no was the answer. No problem - 3 hours of caviar, mango, fillet steak and Krug ensued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then lo and behold - about 25 minutes from landing, the purser found me and said (verbatim) - "are you the young chap whose dad broke the sound barrier? Capt Bannister would like to know if you would like to sit on the jump seat for landing." I levitated to the cockpit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Was strapped in, given headphones - told not to talk unless spoken to (nicely of course). Mike Bannister did say to me that I was one of the few people (of 100) to actually pay any interest to the flight systems aspect - which was why he asked if I was keen to join them for landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oh the good old days!!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time we lived in Brockham and as a bonus it transpired that Bill Clinton and Air Force One was in the circuit and as it was explained to me - there was an exclusion zone whilst Air Force 1 was on finals? So we had to do 2 laps of the Ockham circuit. Which as fate would have it was almost directly over my house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all a surreal experience - just over 24 hours LHR - JFK - LHR return - didn't sleep a wink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So not really a contribution to the thread - but a memory of a whirlwind, never to be repeated 24 hours. I think I was unbelievably lucky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About the only thing I recall about Concorde (by way of a question) that I can't recall seeing here was when Concorde visited Auckland in the late 70's? Was the damage to either the rudder or a stabiliser? Surely at Mach 2.0 the vibrations/difference in control would be marked? From memory the flight crew was interviewed and I'm sure they said they didn't notice anything? Comments?
