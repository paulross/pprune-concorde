  I used to work for BA at BHX (Engineering). BHX was one of the BA diversion airfields for when LHR got fogged out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few of us were therefore trained on non BHX based aircraft types in case of diversions. On my shift, I was trained on the B747 and my colleage on Concorde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course we didn't see these aircraft very often, but when we did we had to get out the old course notes to refresh

  .

  However, whenever Concorde turned up, my overriding memory was of my colleage who was obsessed with 'keeping her warm" - at all costs. I remember an occasion where the GPU, that had been running for a few hours (connected to a Concorde), ran out of diesel and therefore the power dropped off-line. I thought my colleage was going to have a heart attack - he did not come down from orbit until power was restored and everything appeared 'normal' again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think that this was something drummed into him whilst on his Concorde training course
