  Ozgrade3,
  <br/>
  I would say those books already have been written... from the autobiographies of Turcat and Trubshaw, through the books by people like Brian Calvert, Christopher Orlebar and others, to the Haynes "Concorde Owners' Workshop Manual" (!), that's come out recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I've written some bits and pieces, but it's more for my offspring, to explain what all that Concorde junk and documentation in the shed is all about, so they don't all thrash it when I'm gone... I don't think my story would interest a larger public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As M2dude says, we just like to share some of our experiences with those who are interested.

  Christian, this is a wonderful book by the late Brian Calvert, in that although he goes into quite a few of the more intriguing Concorde technicalities, he does so in a manner that is easily understandable, even by me
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/boohoo.gif" title="Boo Hoo"/>
  , and gives a wonderful insight into what it was really like to fly this amazing aeroplane. I had the pleasure of working with Brian on a 1994 BBC2 Concorde documentary, my brother had the shock of his life while on holiday in Mauritius the same year, when he picked up a copy of The Times only to see Brian and I 'posing' together in a publicity photo for the programme.
  <br/>
  The other two Concorde books that I would personally recommend are 'New Shape in the Sky', by Ken Owen and 'Supersonic Secrets' by Rob and Edwin Lewis. These two books, one old and one quite new, are absolute Concorde classics in my very humble opinion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Best Regards
  <br/>
  Dude

      Peronally, I still remember vaguely there's a tale of the customers of a country pub somewhere in England actually chartering a Concorde for a "round-the-bay" flight, but I've never been able to find the full story.

  Hi Christiaan and all,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A little bit of further digging on this trip has revealed ..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Brian Calvert was a pilot on the very first commercial Concorde flight, and a regular at The Bell Inn. Ian Macaulay asked whether it would be possible to take a trip on it and Brian made it possible to arrange. As a result, on 19th September 1978 one hundred people paid \xa3100 each to make the first ever chartered flight in the supersonic airliner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I wonder how many drinks it took them to convince Brian Calvert it would be a good idea
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="http://cdn.pprune.org/images/smilies/evil.gif" title="Evil"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also a reference to Concorde in the Aldworth Millennium Tapestry that was made in 1999 showing.

  I am very lucky to live only 30 miles from G-BOAC and have made several visits including doing the technical tours - although nothing like the detail that I have learnt from yourselves
  <img alt="" border="0" class="post_inline_image" src="http://images.ibsrv.net/ibsrv/res/src:www.pprune.org/get/images/smilies/thumbs.gif"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to Christiaan's question about how the technical tours were done in comparision to F-BTSD at Le Bourget, unfortunatley it only looks like lighting power is supplied to the A/C - no hydraulics seem to be 'left intact' and working which is a huge shame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For me it only shows that 'she' (or 'he'
  <img alt="" border="0" class="post_inline_image" src="http://images.ibsrv.net/ibsrv/res/src:www.pprune.org/get/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
  ) is a very special entity that did prove to be so much more than just a 'machine'. Even though she isn't flying, you still catch yourself standing in awe each time you see her. at first I wasn't sure about AC's new 'hangar', but apart from keeping her dry, I must admit it does add atmosphere to the occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheers
  <br/>
  Andy

      if restricted to 250kts (way below min drag) you'd get pretty poor rates of climb - about 1000fpm if you were lucky
      <br/>
      Wow, that's pretty bad. You'd figure with a T/W ratio of around 0.40 you'd do far better than most other aircraft.

  With respect, that sounds more like the sort of climb rate associated with noise abatement rather than full power. Brian Calvert quotes 250 kts/2000ft/1000fpm/12deg attitude/reduced thrust for this. At 8000ft/400 kts/dry climb thrust he quotes 3000fpm, which is more the sort of number I would have expected (it is all a long time ago ......)

  Then what does 250 kts, 19-degrees of climb, afterburners engaged produce?
